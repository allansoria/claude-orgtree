"""The orgtree MCP server every agent node loads — its hands on the org.

A minimal, dependency-free MCP stdio server (JSON-RPC 2.0). Identity comes from env
(ORGTREE_ORG / ORGTREE_NODE, set by the supervisor at spawn); every call forwards to
the orgtree API on localhost with that identity as the actor, so the LEDGER enforces
authority, budgets, capability subsets, addressing rules, and the no-defaults hire
rule — the schemas here mirror those rules so agents see them up front.

Run: python -m orgtree.mcptool   (spawned by Claude Code via --mcp-config)

# message, hire, retire or spend on anybody's org.
#
# Identity comes from the PROCESS environment orgtree sets per spawn
# (measured 2026-09-01: `agy` passes its env through to stdio MCP children),

# /tmp, and `find` is Windows FIND.EXE. This card previously said a dog "runs
# WITH YOUR HANDS (needs your bash)", agents reasonably read that as "write
# bash", and their dogs then matched nothing forever while reporting
# `state: armed, fired: 0` — which is also exactly what a healthy dog waiting
# on a condition reports. Three dogs on this machine were dead that way for
# up to nine days before anyone could tell.
#
# `os.name` here is the right proxy: this server runs beside the shell its
# dogs get — on the host for a host org, inside the container for a sandboxed
# one. Both idioms are spelled out anyway, so a wrong guess still leaves the
# reader informed rather than confidently mistaken.
