// ------------------------------------------------------------- freeze kinds
// WHICH KIND OF FREEZE IS THIS? One classification, rendered three ways — the
// org banner's note (App.tsx), the desk badge (desk.tsx) and the compact card
// badge (cards.tsx). They are three registers of one question, and before this
// existed each made its own two-way test and every one of them ended in the
// same `else` reading "usage limit".
//
// ⚠ THAT DEFAULT IS THE BUG THIS FIXES, TWICE OVER. Every kind the payload
// could not describe fell through to "usage limit" and the display said it
// confidently:
//   · an AUTH freeze (`cause === "auth"`, the credential was rejected) carries
//     `limit: true` — it is a usage-limit freeze in SHAPE only. It read as
//     "usage limit hit", telling the operator to wait for capacity when the
//     fix is to replace a credential. ▶ really does resume it, so it is
//     counted; only the words were wrong.
//   · a SPEND freeze read as "usage limit" on the node badge. The org banner
//     was right about it only because it returns early on the org-level
//     `spend_frozen` flag — a badge has no org flag to consult.
// Both were invisible until `ledger.tree()`'s frozen projection was taught to
// carry `cause` and `spend`; it rebuilds the record key by key and silently
// drops whatever it does not name.
//
// ⚠ ORDER IS MEANING, not style. `limit_locked` outranks everything: a fable
// lock's clock can never fire, so naming any other kind there would promise a
// reset that nobody performs. `spend` outranks `limit` because a spend freeze
// also carries limit-ish shape but is released by raising the limit, not by
// waiting. `auth` outranks `limit` for the same reason — same shape, different
// remedy. `connection` is last of the real kinds because it is the only one
// that retries itself.

// The two badge registers. They live here, beside the classification and as
// data, for one reason: as inline ternaries in the JSX they could not be
// tested for the property that actually matters — that every kind gets its
// OWN words. A collapsed branch (two kinds sharing a string) is exactly the
// failure being fixed, and it is invisible unless something compares the
// labels to each other. `freezelabel.test.ts` asserts both maps are TOTAL over
// FreezeKind and that no two kinds share a label.

// prime which will restart the orgs reading this says so, and a prime which
// will NOT (target 'mailhub' rebuilds a container and touches no agent) does
// not get to wear the same words.
//
// ⚠ The record is MACHINE-WIDE: api.py injects the same value into every org's
// tree, so most of this chip's audience did not arm it and is only finding out
// here. That is what the title has to serve — who armed it, why, whether THIS

// ------------------------------------------------ edge jump card placement
// user bug 2026-08-26: the jump cards sat at a fixed 6px from the window edge
// and overlapped the focused desk on a narrow window. Cards are SQUARE, and a
// focus glide fits one to min(vw, vh) − 48 centred, so on any window taller
// than it is wide the strip beside the desk is exactly 24px — while a full
// card wants 186. Worse, coworkers share a layout row, so the card's elevation
// lands mid-screen: over the chat text, not over a corner.
//
// Placement is chosen from the desk's MEASURED screen rect rather than from
// the window, so hand-zooming past the standard fit behaves the same way —
// including the case where the focus zoom is floored at Z_DESK and the desk
// overflows the viewport entirely (see centerOn), where the gutter goes
// negative and only the bare tab can sit in the desk's own padding.
//
// The shortage flips axes: a narrow window has thin gutters but a deep band
// above and below the desk, a wide window the reverse. So prefer the gutter,
// fall back to the band (which keeps the NAME — the thing worth keeping), and
// only shed content when neither has room. A near-square window is the one
// shape that is tight both ways, and that is what the tab form is for.
// ⚠ EJ_MID IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A GUESS, and it must stay one. jsdom has no
// box model, so the unit test cannot check any of these against a rendered
// card — it can only assume them. `tests/edgejump_probe.py` renders the real
// markup against the real sheet in Edge and fails if a form outgrows its
// number here; it reads these constants directly out of this file so the two
// cannot drift apart. First measurement came in at 101.63px against a guessed

 *    · `archived_at` is the retire time, and a dissolve stamps an entire
 *      subtree with ONE instant — the order it produces for the common case
 *      (a team retired together) is a single tie, i.e. no order at all.
 *
 *  0 = never ran. A positive timestamp always beats it, so a fresh hire that

 *  (cards.tsx), and the compact map eye (OrgCanvas.tsx) each wrote
 *  `asks > 0 ? asks : unread` out by hand with its own title string — and
 *  they had ALREADY diverged before this feature (the bell's tooltip named
 *  the unread count alongside the asks; EyeDesk's said only "your inbox").
 *  Threading a THIRD input through four hand-written copies is exactly how
 *  one of them ends up wrong, and this codebase has paid for that shape more
 *  than once (freeze labels, three surfaces, one wrong default in each).
 *
 *  THE RULE. Attention = open asks + unread URGENT mail (D-169: an agent may
 *  tag user-bound mail urgent, and the inbox then pulses the way it does for
 *  an unanswered question). When that total is non-zero it OVERRIDES the
 *  ordinary unread count and pulses.
 *
 *  THE ZERO EDGE, stated because the spec did not settle it: with nothing
 *  urgent and no ask open, an inbox holding ordinary unread mail falls back
 *  to the plain unread count, NOT pulsing — 12 unread reads "12", quietly.
 *  The two branches are named (`attention` vs `unread`) rather than nested
 *  so which is which can be read rather than inferred.
 *
 *  ⚠ `urgent_unread` is a SUBSET of `user_inbox_count` (both count entries

/** G5 — the panel heartbeat.
 *
 *  An audit of the read endpoints found 18 of 19 call sites fetching ONCE on
 *  mount: open a panel, and whatever it showed at that instant is what it
 *  shows until you close it. Some of those panels display data that changes
 *  while you are looking at it — mail arriving, an agent writing files, disk
 *  filling — and the node inbox had a workaround for exactly this, refetching
 *  when a `pulse` prop changed, which covered turn events and nothing else
 *  (a mail delivery is not a pulse).
 *
 *  Same rule as the tree and the chat: liveness is gated on "this panel is
 *  mounted", which is known locally and cannot be stale — never on a piece of
 *  the data being refreshed. The fetcher is held in a ref so an inline arrow
 *  does not restart the timer on every render; `deps` decides identity.
