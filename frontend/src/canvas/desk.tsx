  // `grow()` writing `style.height` imperatively as a draft gets longer, the
  // mobile keyboard resizing the sheet, a font finishing its load. (NOT the
  // eye cell's .35s width transition — `.eye-inner` is sized from the
  // VIEWPORT via `eyeW`, so its interior width is constant while the cell
  // animates, and `.desk-over` clips rather than re-lays-out.) What keeps this
  // off the spring engine's per-frame path is stronger than that argument
